non-semantic:  <b>, <div>, <span> -->

<!-- <article> because the text in the article would make sense if extracted to the page and placed somewhere else. It's self-contained and reusable -->

<!-- We could use <blockquote> because it is an extended quotation. best solution is to nest the blockquote within an article since it's a standalone item. -->

<!-- <section> because it represents grouped thematic content (describes the text-align property). appears to be part of a larger body of work but isnt a standalone block like an article. -->

<!-- <aside> because the text does not appear to be part of the main document flow and isn't a standalone article -->
